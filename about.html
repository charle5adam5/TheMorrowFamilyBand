The Morrow Family Band, a.k.a. Cimarron, has been playing
music throughout North Florida and South Georgia since 1999.
Original members Jim and Melinda Morrow have been joined by
their daughter, Dawn Morrow, to create a hip and timeless
trio of family talent and charisma. Their song list consists
of an eclectic mix of Top 40, Singer/Songwriter, Old Country,
New Country, Classic Rock, Folk, Pop, and Rock songs ranging
from Merle Haggard to Lana Del Rey. Their energetic stage
presence and undeniable family charm are a must have at any
bar, restaurant, or private event!
