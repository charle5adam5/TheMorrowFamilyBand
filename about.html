      Local to St. Augustine, Florida, The Morrow Family Band has been playing music throughout 
      North Florida and South Georgia since 1999. Original members Jim and Melinda Morrow have been 
      joined by their daughter, Dawn Morrow Adams. Their sound features strong acoustic roots and 
      familial harmonies with a southern flair.

      Not only do they cover an eclectic mix of Top 40 and Indie favorites, they have a climbing 
      repertoire of originals under their belts. Their musical influences include: Gillian Welch, 
      Don Oja-Dunaway, Nickel Creek, Tom Petty, John Prine, and more. Their energetic stage presence 
      and undeniable family charm are a must have at any festival, bar, restaurant, or private event.
