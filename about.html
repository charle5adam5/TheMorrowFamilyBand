music throughout North Florida and South Georgia since 1999.
Original members Jim and Melinda Morrow have been joined by
their daughter, Dawn Morrow, to create a hip and timeless
trio of family talent and charisma. Their song list consists
of an eclectic mix of Top 40, Singer/Songwriter, Old Country,
New Country, Classic Rock, Folk, Pop, and Rock songs ranging
from Merle Haggard to Lana Del Rey. Their energetic stage
